# weather_app
I wrote simple weather program. You type city and get result of temperature and cloud situation. It was made for API from openweather. 
Modules used: tkinter, request, json

With temperature it's changing color of background and give some "annoying" comment. You need API key from openweather. 
Openweather give basic api key for free.

By default there is inserted London.
